# Magic8BallSpanishApp
C++ Magic 8 Ball app for my Spanish 4 class, made in QT Creator.

Run the `.exe` file within the `release` build. ([Zipped file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k5K6dLc8xswPZ1EadpNPvtb1MAw9iJEn?usp=sharing) for easier download)

Sorry for the hodgepodge of MacOS/Windows path syntax; I developed this on a Windows VM.

[The `Images` folder](https://github.com/2435191/Magic8BallSpanishApp/tree/main/release/Images) contains all the `.png` files used in the project. 
[`items.csv`](https://github.com/2435191/Magic8BallSpanishApp/blob/main/release/items.csv) is a mapping of Spanish phrases to the corresponding images.
